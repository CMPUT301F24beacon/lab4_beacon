This is a Lab 4 Participation which includes 6 members of team 'beacon' with contributors:<br>samia225<br>zahid2011<br>S-a-m-i-0<br>krishnav-arora<br>SAB-10<br>Adreet21<br>
### PLEASE NOTE:<br> 
An extra account 'rohanjethwani17' appears in the contributors list because I (krishnav-arora) while trying to work on my MAC faced issues to connect to my Github account. Therefore, i used my friend's (rohanjethwani17) laptop to use Git bash to connect to my Github account but while committing changes on my repo, we are able to see my name(krishnav-arora) as well as his name(rohanjethwani17) and therefore adding him to the list of contributors.
